# PeakIdentificationAlgorithm
Code package for automated peak identification in complex mass spectra. 

Please refer to Mickwitz et al. (2025) for further details about the algorithm processes. If you do use the algorithm for analysis of data, please cite the afore mentioned paper.

This code is copywrite to Valter Mickwitz. All contributions are welcome. Due to limited testing and userbase bugs and crashes are likely, if you do not have time to update the code accordingly please do not hesitate to contact valter.mickwitz@helsinki.fi. With more users and reports the code can be improved over time. 

I thank the Heikki Junninen and the tofWare team for inspiring this project.
